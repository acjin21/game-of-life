# John Conway's Game of Life Simulator

John Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player "game" in which a two-dimensional grid of squares transitions between different patterns based on a set of rules that simulate cell growth and death. 


Specific rules and more information on the game can be found on the game's [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) page:
"  
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction  cellular "
